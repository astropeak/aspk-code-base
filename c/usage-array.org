* Array
** array name VS address of first element
   Array name has two meaning in different cases.
   1. it is the same as &a[0]. Acturally, the compiler do the convert.
   2. it represent an array. sizeof(a);

   x[y] means: start with the pointer x, step y elements forward after what the pointer points to, and then take whatever is there.
   
   int a[7];
   *(a+1) is the same as a[1];
   the name a in a[3] must first be converted to a pointer (to the first element in a).
