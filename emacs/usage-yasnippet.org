      Below is an example of snippet
      #+begin_src org
      # -*- mode: snippet -*-
      # name: src
      # key: src
      # --
      ,#+begin_src ${1:language}
      $0
      ,#+end_src
      #+end_src
   3. press ~C-c C-c~ to save the snippet(command is ~yas-load-snippet-buffer-and-close~)
      
      Given the mode and name. 
      
      The snippet will be saved to *first directory* in ~yas-snippet-dirs~, which is ~Dropbox/project/emacs.d/local-snippet~ now. Great!!
*** naming convention for a new snippet file
    - for org mode source block, the name is 's' concat file suffix of that programming language. eg: 'spl' is for generating a src block with language set to perl; 'spy' for python; 'ssh' for shell.
