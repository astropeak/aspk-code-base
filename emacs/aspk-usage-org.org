** list
   The official doc: http://orgmode.org/guide/Plain-lists.html

   Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.
   
   Unordered list items start with ‘-’, ‘+’, or ‘*’ as bullets.
   Ordered list items start with ‘1.’ or ‘1)’.
   Description list use ‘ :: ’ to separate the term from the description. 

   An example of description list(That is definition list in html):
   - Apple :: a sweet frute
   - Banana :: Yellow
   - Pear :: oven
