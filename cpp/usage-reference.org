* reference
** What happened when assign a reference to another reference
   The two references both refer to the original variable. The only one priciple: when a reference variable used as right value, it it indentical as if the original variable was used.

** Reference value must be initialized when declaration, and can't be changed latter
   If you try to change a reference variable, compiler will not report error. But it will have no effect.
