** invalid initialization of non const reference with a rvalue
  struct Person {
  int age;
  Person(int _age): age(_age) {}
};

void printAge(Person &person) {
   cout << "Age: " << person.age << endl;
}

int main () {
  Person p(50);
  printAge(Person(50));  // fails!
  printAge(p);
  return 0;
}

The error I get is:

error: invalid initialization of non-const reference of type ‘Person&’ from an rvalue of type ‘Person’

   Root cause: The actual problem is the other way around. You are passing a temporary(rvalue) to a function which expects an lvalue.
** passing 'const Checker' as 'this' argument discards qualifiers
   Reason: if an object is const, then it can only call const member function. Because if it call a non const function, then 'this' may be modified in the function body, which is confilict with the const qualifier of that object.

   Error message given by gcc:
/cygdrive/e/home/Dropbox/project/syncbox/SyncTrans.hpp:8:51: error: passing ‘const Checker’ as ‘this’ argument discards qualifiers [-fpermissive]
         int status = itsChk.execute(client, server);
** ifstream and ofstream don't have copy constructor
‘std::ios_base::ios_base(const std::ios_base&)’ is private
   So you can't return they from a function.

** cmake: link error: can't find a c function.
   The reason is that c functions should be exclosed in 'extern "C"' brace pair.
