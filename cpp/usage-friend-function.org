* Friend function
  http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_friend_functions.htm

  A friend function to a class is a function that defined outside that class, but can access the class's private member variables.
  Just add a line like below to add a friend functio to a class:
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Box {
public:
xxxx
friend void printBox(Box box);
private:
int number;
};

void printBox(Box box) {
cout<<box.number<<endl;
}
  #+end_src

  To add all member functions of class B to class A as friend function, just add a line line ~friend classB~ to declaration of class A.
