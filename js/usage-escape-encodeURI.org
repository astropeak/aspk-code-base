* escape & encodeURI
  Encode special characters in an URI to %XX(where XX is the hex ascii code for that character), so that these characters are not parsed as special characters. Such as if '/' should be parsed as a regular character instead of a component seperator, then is should be encoded to %XX.

  Note: URI is part of URL.

** docs
   Compare escape, encodeURI, encodeURIComponent: 
   http://xkr.us/articles/javascript/encode-compare/. 
   And give a live example.
