    MMMM
    print $str
    #+end_src
    
    #+RESULTS:

    : this is a
    :     string

*** ~q~ or ~qq~ operator
    syntax: q{STR go here}, or qq{STR go here}.
    for variable interpolating, q like ', qq line ".

    #+begin_src perl :results output
    $name="Jim";
    $str = qq{$name
    this is a
        string
        that spreads on
        several lines.
    
    Good};
    print $str;
    #+end_src
