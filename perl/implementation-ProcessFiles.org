* Implementation ProcessFiles
** what
   Framework for processing multiple files. Have 5 actions:
   | action   | description   |
   |----------+---------------|
   | pre_all  | for all files |
   | pre      | for single    |
   | action   | for single    |
   | post     | for single    |
   | post_all | for all files |
   And the running order is the same as they appear in table.

** two method
   1. by class inheritance. Sub class redefine method such as 'pre', 'action', to achieve different beheavior.
   2. by object composition. The class provide a 'register' function to register action functions. This one is more flexiable.

   The basic problem is flow control.
