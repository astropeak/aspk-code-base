* responsive web design
  responsive web design makes a web page looks good on all devices, because it will change its appearence when the device changes.
  
  responsive web design is about using CSS and html to resize, shrink, move, hide the content to make it look good on any screen.
  
** docs
   In this artical, just use float:left to implement responsive web.

   But it also give a link to w3.css, which is a pure css framework to design responsive web:

** thinking
   Use @media to set different css for different screen width.
   
   3列float:left元素可以自动实现‘换行’，当总宽度变化时。
   
** problems
   1. 如何将footer置底？
      使用absolute当然可以，但当页面高度大于屏幕高度时，footer仍然显示在屏幕最底端，这是错误的。
      
** points
   1. ~float:left~ is same as ~display:inline-block~ when display element in one line
      #+begin_src css
      nav, section, aside {
        /* float:left; */
        display:inline-block;
        vertical-align:top;
      }
      #+end_src
