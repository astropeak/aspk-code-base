   | grid_X       | X can be 1-12. Define a box X columns width             |
   | prefix_X     | X can be 1-11. Leave X columns padding before box       |
   | suffix_X     | X can be 1-11. Leave X columns padding after box        |
   | push_X       | X can be 1-12. Move box X columns to right relatively   |
   | pull_X       | X can be 1-12. Move box X columns to left relatively,   |
   |              | Thus push_X and pull_X don't affect position of         |
   |              | following elements cause they're relatively positioned. |
   | clear        | At every new line, clear is used.                       |

   Note:
   - prefix and suffix is implemented by padding-left or padding-right property
   - push and pull are implemented by set the element's position to relative and then set left or right property
   - grid is implemented by float:left, and given it a width. Also display is set to inline(may be just for browser quirks).
   - grid can be nested.
