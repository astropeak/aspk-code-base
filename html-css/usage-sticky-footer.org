  1. strench body to take 100% height
  2. set footer margin-top to minus its height, the effect is lift the footer by its height.

  The example is saved in ./usage-sticky-footer/index.html.
  Problem in this example: the scrool bar will be displayed. But after set margin to 0, the problem solved.
